# 2016Election

This is an R Shiny application to visualize 2016 Election Data and relevant demographic information. It is intended to give users the chance to explore spatial relations in the data and discover trends. Current functionality is limited to displaying statewide demographic data/results due to rendering speed, however the following features will be added in the next week: at least 12 more variables, LISA mapping functionality, side-by-side mapping, regional mapping options. 

The following variables can be mapped with this R Shiny App: % Vote for Hillary, % of People Aged 5+ in a Household Speaking a Foreign Language, % Black, and % Hispanic.
