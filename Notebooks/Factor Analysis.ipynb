    "# Factor Analysis\n",
    "By Lorenz Menendez & Isaac Kamber\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Notebook will show how we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in R to better understand voting outcomes in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. This Notebook begins by importing election and demographic data for outlying counties (i.e. counties who voted significantly differently than their neighbording counties). Then, we show you how to construct a correlation matrix in R, validate the effectiveness of a PCA analysis, and finanlly complete the PCA analysis. Along the way, we touch on some of the statistical reasoning behind our choice of statistical methods as they relate to our interpretation of the election data. A more detailed account on implementing PCA can he found at the [UCLA Institute for Digital Reserach & Education](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/seminars/introduction-to-factor-analysis/a-practical-introduction-to-factor-analysis/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific Goals\n",
    "Running a PCA will help better understand which characteristics define outlying counties by reducing the number of variables (or \"dimensions\") so we can interpret overall trends. At the end of the analysis, we will have a breakdown of how each demographic variable contributed to more general components which are themselves uncorrelated."
